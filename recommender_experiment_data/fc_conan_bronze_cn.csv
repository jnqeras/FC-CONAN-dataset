95% of British Muslims feel a loyalty to the UK and contribute over 31 billion pounds to the UK economy. They look like a valuable part of the community to me. (statistics from MEND.org.uk)
A true follower of the quran is not allowed to initiate a war and even when a just war breaks out muslims are not allowed to kill innocent people.
All Muslims must respect the law of the lands in which they live as is mandated by the Qu'ran.
Apart from all the scientists that are also muslim?
"As you said, it is extremism which does not represent the majority of Muslims. We do not want more fear or hate speech in our life. We could help people know the true Muslims by reading the facts and conversing with your Muslim neighbors."
Biased media coverage over-represents Muslims as committing these crimes. How much media attention does the Vatican's child sex abuse scandal got in comparison?
"Bit of a generalisation that, isn't it? If you cannot see that most Muslims contribute positively to the UK, you need to do a quick google search I think."
"Child rapes are not only convicted by muslims. In fact, around 90% of the sexual abuse are convicted by person known to the child. This is a sad truth. We should help children be free from sexual abuse and rape."
Child rapists are a tiny sick minority across all communities. Islam does not condone it and Muslims do not accept it.
Did you know that Muslims introduced universities to Europe? So the knowledge Western societies are built on.
Do you have the evidence that now there are more crimes than there were in the previous decades? I do not have such statistics. Arrival of immigrants has nothing to deal with the increase of crimes.
"Do you have the statistics for domestic violence in Great Britain? This is even a huger problem in Great Britain! I'd suggest we first should think about our inner problems, and you suggest to just blame the outsiders in everything!"
"Every Muslim is also a potential peacemaker, doctor, philanthropist. What is your point?"
Evidence for this please?
Evidence for this? All crime and hatred is wrong.
Evidence please?
Except all of those which live and add to Western Societies.
"Given the number of Muslims born in the UK, this statement in a bit silly.you cannot repatriate someone who hasn't moved."
"Have you ever truely understand the religion Islam, including its history, principles, or teaching? Islam actually teaches people to respect life and care for people. It is also what the majority of Muslims follow."
"Horrific crimes of child sexual abuse and rape are not isolated to a single religion, and are tragically widespread in many societies across the globe."
How can you say this about hundreds of millions of people?
I am curious where did you get those thoughts from. The truth is that Islamic teachings criticize violence and crime.
"I do not shared your opinion, but I do acknowledge that opinions, mine or your, do not have to be based on fact or knowledge. My 'experience' of Muslims, as neighbours, colleagues, friends hasn't led me to view them as a problem."
I think that is a stereotype mainly as a result of people know little about Islam and Muslims.
"I thought 'Totalitarianism' was the requirement of total subservience to the STATE, rather than to any particular faith. So no, the spread of matters of personal belief would not be necessarily 'totalitarian'."
If they were violent they would have been punished too. Why do you think someone of a certain religion is automatically guilty?
"If we excluded everyone who had prejudice, who would be left?"
"If we invite people to live and work in our country, to fill the mills and factories, of the 1970's, for example, its a bit of cheek to turn around decades later and describe their grand kids as an invasion or a plague, do not you think?"
If you do not think Muslims have ever done anything for 'us' I think you need to do a quick google search. The evidence of Muslims contributions to society is everywhere!
In fact at no point does the Quran tell people to Hate or kill others. There are a lot of lies and out of context quotes floating around. It does however instruct people to behave justly towards non believers and prevents forced conversion.
"In my opinion, many people want to emigrate to London means London is a charming and enjoyable place for living. Isn't that a wonderful thing and we should keep this trait?"
"In the US, Muslims are more likely to be tolerant of LGBT+ people than Christians. Any religion can be used to persecute certain groups, it is the interpretation of it by it is followers that matters."
Invasion? Don't you think this expression is slightly over dramatic? People simply want to live in one of the best cities in the world!
Is this true? Where is your source?
"Islam does belong in our multicultural Western society. Unfortunately for you, intolerance doesn't."
"Islam does not agitate for war or violence. On the countrary, most of the 50 Muslim-majority countries around the world are at peace. Uk is a Christian-majority country, while there has been knife and gun issues over last 20 years."
Islam is all about love and tolerance [insert quote].
"Islam shares the same roots as Christianity and Judaism and all are based on love, tolerance and peace, so that is a good thing isn't it."
"Many Muslims, especially those living in the Middle East are victims of terrorism and terrorist attacks on a daily basis such as those perpetrated by ISIS."
Many groups of people feel excluded for many reasons and should be supported.
"Mate, the media is constantly biased against Muslims and tries to make them out to be the enemy. What we hardly ever see is the many more positive stories."
Maybe prejudice and xenophobia are incompatible with any Western society?
Maybe you are the one that needs to assimilate to living in a multicultural society with people who are different from you?
"Migrants, like those from Pakistan, benefit the UK massively, and migration does not increase the occurrence of crimes like rape, in fact crime rates stay the same or go down, in areas with high immigration: https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/uk-migration-six-myths-about-immigration-debunked-as-latest-figures-show-fall-in-non-eu-arrivals-a6895341.html."
"More of our children are killed by cars, assaulted by people they know or in positions of trust like sports coach, church or authority figure. Its horrible but if we really want to protect children start there. #truthproject."
"Muslims aren't rapists or murderers, in fact many Muslims are doing good things to fight the extremists falsely appropriating Islam: https://5pillarsuk.com/2019/01/03/muslim-woman-praised-for-aiding-victims-of-new-years-eve-terror-attack-in-manchester/."
Muslims contribute a lot to our society. What are you contributing other than intolerance?
No religion is peaceful. Every religion had been provoking religious wars and murdering people. Islam is not that different in this respect from other religions.
"No, it is not a fact because it is simply not true."
No. A faith of 1.6 billion people from all walks of life helps make up humanity.
No. A religion of 1.6 billion people is not the same as Nazism and it is ignorant to say so.
No. Having a diverse society is a positive. There is no 'invasion'.
"People have the right to belong to any religion they want. If you do not like their religion, it does not mean that they are bad!"
People's concerns must be based in evidence and not hatred.
"Perhaps invented clocks, surgical instruments and maps? You are welcome."
"Perhaps we should stop exporting goods or buying stuff from from Islamic countries? While were at it give back their numbers, maths and architecture?"
"Pipe bombs were sent to Trump's opposition, including Robert De Niro, this scapegoating of Muslims is the real problem and blinds us to the bigger picture."
"Rapists are, in most cases, friends, family, or partners of the victim. The proportion of Pakistani people who are rapists is no more than that of White British population."
"Really? Even the surgeons, doctors and nurses that keep our NHS going? Those that keep public transport running, working families fed with take outs and corner shops, the ones winning gold medals in sports, entertainment awards and science."
Replace islam with any other religion and see just how deeply offensive what you just said is.
Seems odd given that Western Society was build on the backs of the rest of the world.
"Seriously, I would love to know where you get your statistics from. They are so far from the truth."
So much hatred. We must respect and understand all peoples.
So their faith and belief in the teachings of God guides them to a virtuous path of public service. What exactly are you complaining about?
Sounds like you are generalizing what a very small percentage of extremists do to an entire religion.
Sounds more like the Catholic church to me #pope#childabuse #InquiryCSA.
Such dehumanising language against many people.
"That is an unusual thought. Muslims are human beings like the rest of us. And, as all human beings, they can integrate into any society should the need arise."
"That is what biased news reports would have you believe, but violent incidents are committed by people of all faiths, muslims just get reported on more."
"That is why they are surgeons, doctors, teachers, entrepreneurs."
The majority of Muslims worldwide are peaceful.
"The majority of sexual assaults are committed by a family member, friend, or partner of the victim, and only 12% of convicted rapists are Muslim. It is not the religion, its the individuals, whether they're Muslim or not."
The media is not ignoring those rape crimes. Those who commit the crimes are extremists. The majority of Muslims are peaceful and respect people. It is better we think about how we can prevent the crimes.
The quran says that muslims should not seek hostility towards those who haven't sought any war against them. Jihadists do not represent the islamic faith.
The real disgrace is that children are being force fed intolerance of others and hate from tweets like this!
"The vast majority of Muslims do not condone violence or rape. Don't believe the sensationalist media stories that focus on a select few extreme cases, and under-report on non-muslim crimes."
The world would be a better place if people were more tolerant to each other.
These actions are not the fault of an entire community?
"They are here because we went there, took their wealth, food and industry and then invited them to come here to work our factories, NHS and transport."
"This is a disgusting thing to say, you would not say this about non-Muslims would you?"
This is not true and your argument does not make sense as hatred does not counter hatred.
This is not true.
This is not true. How can you say that about 1.6 billion people?
This is not true. How can you say this about an entire faith? This is just hatred.
This is not true. They are non-Muslim terrorists out there. Have you forgotten?
To ban people you respect from practicing their faith because of the actions of a few does seem more that a bit unfair?
"Tolerance of people with different religious beliefs is not an illness, hatred and fear of people different than you sounds much more unhealthy."
Using intolerance and discrimination against anyone different? Sounds like a western issue.
"We have no right to blame other people. Analysis showed that large majority of people convicted of sexual offences, regardless of the age of the victims, are white."
What do you mean? What point are you making?
"What happened to the good old British values of stuff like 'tolerance' and 'respect for the rule of law' - what you are suggesting sounds like mob rule, vigilante action and people running around with burning torches?"
What have 'all' Pakistani people done to deserve deportation? Sweeping generalisations like this are divisive and fuel false fearmongering around migrants.
Where is your evidence for this? This is just hatred.
Where is your evidence for this? This is simply not true.
"Who can say that Muslims are privileged? They are reminded too often that their religion is not welcome here. I do not see where you find double standards as all criminals are judged and punished, Muslim criminals are also judged by their own community."
Why are you attacking muslims? Many people come and live in Britain and I do not see why it is a bad thing.
Why do you link rapist crimes and Muslim people? Do you have anny proofs for that?
Why is this a muslim issue? A faith of 1.6 billion all violent?
Why? What is wrong about learning about a world religion that many of their peers practice?
"You have a stance, that is your right. But it is not your right to decide for other people (your children and grandchildren) and insult other people."
